== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= This sounds too good to be true, what is the catch? =

It does, doesn't it! We bypass multiple organisations (3 to 4) who are typically involved in a card payment and each taking a share of fees. We make payments happen by working directly with the banks, substantially bringing down the cost of payment for UK.

We pass this benefit to your shoppers and yourself creating a win for everyone.

= Do shoppers need to register with Coupay to make payments? =

Shoppers don’t need to register or leave any of their details with Coupay. We work with UK banks directly for shoppers to complete the payment in just 3 clicks

= Do shoppers need to have Coupay app for this to work? =

They don’t need Coupay app or an account with Coupay. They simply select a UK bank account from which to pay and Coupay works behind the scenes directly with their bank. Their bank then makes the payment after a Strong Customer Authentication(SCA) on their banking app. This is similar to most cards now needing SCA to complete payment.


= How will refunds work? =

You will need to issue a refund instruction to Coupay and return the funds to Coupay. Coupay will issue refund within 24 hours to your shopper.
